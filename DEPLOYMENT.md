# üöÄ StickChef AI Deployment Guide

## Quick Deploy Options

### üèÜ **Option 1: Render (Recommended for 2025)**
**Why Render**: Free tier, custom domains, professional branding, no sleep issues on low traffic

**Step-by-Step (10-15 minutes):**
1. **Prep Repository**:
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "StickChef AI MVP with fusion & sustainability"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Deploy on Render**:
   - Visit [render.com](https://render.com) and sign up
   - Connect your GitHub account
   - Click "New Web Service" and select your repo
   - Render auto-detects Python/Streamlit via `render.yaml`
   - Click "Deploy" - first deployment takes 5-10 minutes

3. **Custom Domain Setup**:
   - Purchase domain (e.g., `stickchef.ai` on Namecheap ~$20/year)
   - Add domain in Render dashboard (free TLS included)
   - Update DNS records as instructed

### Option 2: Streamlit Cloud (Ultra-Simple)
**Best for**: Quick prototypes, don't need custom domain
- Push to GitHub ‚Üí Visit [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io) ‚Üí Deploy

### Option 3: Heroku (Paid Only)
**Note**: No free tier since 2025 - $5/month minimum
- Better for established apps with compliance needs

## Custom Domain Setup
1. Buy domain from Namecheap (~$12/year)
2. Configure DNS to point to deployment URL
3. Enable HTTPS through platform

## Environment Variables
```bash
# For production
STREAMLIT_SERVER_PORT=8501
STREAMLIT_SERVER_ADDRESS=0.0.0.0
FLASK_ENV=production
```

## Performance Optimization
- Use CPU-optimized instances
- Consider model caching for faster load times
- Enable compression for image uploads

## Monitoring
- Set up logging for user interactions
- Track ingredient detection accuracy
- Monitor recipe generation quality

## Security
- Add rate limiting for API endpoints
- Implement image upload size limits
- Enable CORS for specific domains only

## LLC Business Integration
- **Domain & Hosting**: ~$20/year domain + $0 hosting = deductible business expense
- **Professional Branding**: Custom domain enhances credibility for B2B clients
- **Analytics Setup**: Track user metrics for business planning and tax documentation
- **Scaling Path**: Easy upgrade to paid plans as revenue grows
