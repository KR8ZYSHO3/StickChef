Title: "Built an AI that does photo-based ingredient detection + fusion recipes with sustainability scoring"

Hey r/FoodTech! 

Just launched StickChef AI - combines computer vision with generative AI for a unique cooking experience.

**What it does:**
- Photo-based ingredient detection using Faster R-CNN
- Generates fusion recipes (Korean-Italian, Mexican-Japanese, etc.)
- Calculates carbon footprint and sustainability score
- 6-component flavor profile visualization

**Tech Stack:**
- Backend: Flask + Python
- Frontend: Streamlit
- AI: PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers
- Single-file architecture (~1,214 lines)

**Why this matters:**
Most AI recipe apps are text-based and use database lookups. This creates novel fusion combinations from visual input while addressing food waste and environmental impact.
